iOS Coding Kata for SwiftUI and Combine with CoreData 

In order to run this project. Just open the xcode project and run on a device or simulator.
There are no third party frameworks as this uses SwiftUI and Combine, along with CoreData.

TODO: Update readme.. Demo gif coming soon. Add tests and minor clean up code.
